### USDA 56013

By 1980, the craft revolution, though opposed to mass production, still hadn't made anything truly revolutionary. The English-style ales and porters by Anchor, New Albion, Boulder, Newman, and DeBakker represented the classical styles, maybe with just some peculiarities and regional twists. The situation began to change at the start of the 80s, with the third wave of craft startups coming.

In the 1970s, Anchor Brewing Company used every occasion to promote its products.  In 1975, such an occasion handily arrived: the bi-centennial anniversary of the US independence from Britain. To mark this date, Maytag conceived a plan to brew a special celebration ale; and as Fritz had just visited the Timothy Taylor brewery in West Yorkshire, England, he chose traditional English pale ale as a model for his upcoming beer(oh, the irony!). The first effort (a limited batch under the “Liberty Ale” brand) was mediocre and received overt criticism. Maytag persevered and produced a second batch (dubbed “Christmas Ale”) for Christmas of 1975. He abolished two elements outright: adding sugar to the wort and German hops.[ref:steele-ipa:"7":]() In search of a Hallertau replacement, Maytag contacted a farmer named John Segal, known for his expertise in hops. A fortunate coincidence occurred as Segal was just cultivating an experimental specimen No. 56013: a part of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) program aimed at developing new crop varieties. Researchers from Oregon State University, led by Jack Horner, bred the new hops by cross-breeding Fuggle with Russian Serebryanka (and some unknown third variety).

These hops (which soon got their own name: “Cascade,” after the Cascade mountains) turned out to be very interesting. First, they were bitter enough to suit Maytag's goal. Second, apart from bitterness, they demonstrated a unique grapefruit-citrusy aroma and taste.

Fun Fact. The program to develop experimental hops kicked off back in 1933, but the Cascade was the first variety that saw any common usage.

#### The chemistry of hops

The properties of hops (the taste and the corresponding bitterness) depend on the organic compounds they contain. These compounds might be divided into three groups:
  * Alpha acids are isomerized after heating and give the bitter taste to beer and also provide some antiseptic qualities.
  * Beta acids act in the same manner but in the heat are oxidized, not isomerized.
  * Essential oils — the various compounds (most notably humulene, caryophyllene, and myrcene) are responsible for “citrusy,” “piney,” “flowery,” etc., flavors.

Depending on the proportion of these compounds, hops are classified as bittering (typically, boiled with the wort to give bitterness to beer), aromatic (added after boiling and cooling the wort — in a course of so-called “dry hopping”), or dual-use (suit both needs).[ref](https://beermaverick.com/types-of-hops-aroma-noble-bittering-dual-purpose/)

Classical European “noble” hops, such as Hallertau and Saaz, contain 4% alpha acids and a bit more (around 5%) beta acids. Kent hops, namely Fuggle and Golding, contain more of the latter but less of the former. Cascade hops turned out to be richer in all three components![ref](http://www.hopslist.com/)

| Hop variety | Alpha acids   | Beta acids   | Essential oils, in 100 g   |
|-------------|--------------:|-------------:|-------------------------:|
| Hallertau   | 3.5%          | 3.5-4,5%     | 0.6-1.2 ml |
| Saaz        | 2.5-4.5%      | 4.0-6,0%     | 0.4-0.8 ml |
| Golding     | 5.0-6.0%      | 2.0-3.0%     | 0,9 ml     |
| Fuggle      | 2.4-6,1%      | 2.1-2.8%     | 0.4-0.8 ml |
| **Cascade** | **4.5-8.9%**  | **3.6-7.5%** | **0.8-1.5 ml** |

Christmas ale by Anchor Brewing Company differed strikingly from British ales (and even more so compared to contemporary light lagers). It was quite bitter (around 50 IBU; it was definitely an IPA to the British consumers, and to Americans, accustomed to fivefold less bitter pilsners, it should have tasted like hell) yet at the same time aromatic, crisp, and elegant beer.

Initially, the advents and retirements of Christmas Ale (Anchor had been carrying on experimenting, releasing new batches with updated recipes every December) made exactly zero impact on connoisseurs as simply nobody knew about the beer.[ref:acitelli-audacity:"“The Most Influential Beer”":]() New Albion and Boulder (as well as mainstream Coors) were also using Cascade which was “trendy,” but few remember that either. It's not enough to just add aromatic hops to wort. One needs to fit the beverage to encompass all the qualities of the hops.

The general offensive of Cascade upon the beer lovers' taste buds occurred in 1981 as Ken Grossman and Paul Camusi released the first batch of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale: light, Cascade-hopped, bottle-conditioned. The new ale was a hit as sales doubled in one year. Two years later, Maytag made his special pale ale a regular brew — and started to sell it under the restored “Liberty Ale” brand.

The success of Sierra Nevada's creation wasn't merely fortuitous. As Grossman later told, he and Camusi had a clear vision of the highest-quality aromatic ale they were going to make,[ref](https://www.foodandwine.com/beer/craft-beer/25-most-important-american-craft-beers-ever-brewed?slide=ff26a990-6ab3-48f6-9cc0-0b7d3ea33e5b#ff26a990-6ab3-48f6-9cc0-0b7d3ea33e5b) and had spent half a year improving the recipe. The 11th try produced the result that finally satisfied them.[ref:acitelli-audacity:"“The West Coast Style”":]()

#### How to Taste It

The beer style inspired by Anchor *Christmas*/*Liberty Ale* and Sierra Nevada *Pale Ale* is now known as American Pale Ale (APA). Unlike British pale ales that use hops for bittering, American pale ales must be moderately bitter but utterly aromatic.

Some authors (Mitch Steele in particular) do not consider *Liberty Ale* a true APA but rather an IPA, unlike Sierra Nevada *Pale Ale*. Though it's rather hard to mark the exact demarcation between the two styles, we can't but stress that both beverages are very similar to one another, both formally (5.9% ABV / 47 IBU versus 5.6% / 38 IBU) and taste-wise (at least in the author of this book's taste).

Both “breakthrough” beers are still made today. Anchor *Liberty Ale* enjoys the fame of the first craft beer in history as it marked an important milestone: the incipient craft subculture had for the first time made a totally new product, not a replica of an existing one. Sierra Nevada *Pale Ale* is less revered but is still one of the highest-selling craft beers in the world.

Apart from those two, we might recommend several other American pale ales made with Cascade: *Alpha King* by Three Floyds, *Pale Ale* by Founders, *Mirror Pond Pale Ale* by Deschutes, etc. In general, many craft breweries make APAs and Cascade remains one of the most popular hop varieties.

#### …Then they laugh at you

The Sierra Nevada Brewing Company's history at a first glance appears typical for those *early days*. The founders were homebrewers, revered Maytag with his new-old beers, and talked a lot to McAuliffe about how the New Albion Brewery was organized. Most notably, they did one key thing differently: they planned for future growth.

In the 1970s, no bank or venture capitalist imagined funding a beer startup. New Albion Brewery, being formally profitable, wasn't able to raise capital to scale the production, which eventually resulted in the closing of the company. Maytag had to draw from the family budget and spend his personal capital in order to save Anchor. Sierra Nevada was initially built in a manner that would allow future expansion once the planned production capacity started generating income. Furthermore, the estimation proved correct, and the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company is worth more than a billion dollars today.

Grossman and Camusi's success had marked a new era in the Craft Revolution history: brewing startups — new wave, rational and ambitious ones — were not just surviving but expanding and increasing outputs. In 1981, the RedHook brewery opened, in 1983, the Kalamazoo Brewing Company (later renamed Bell's Brewery), in 1984, the Boston Beer Company (the founder of which, Jim Koch, even had a Harvard MBA); all of them are functioning today.

In the meantime, a relentless Papazian organized the Great American Beer Festival (GABF), which name gives a clear hint of what campaign was taken as a role model. In 1982, the first GABF was held in the very same Boulder, Colorado: 22 participants showcased their products to 850 attendees for 5 hours. Not very impressive by today's standards, but that was only the beginning. (Also, a year later, GABF started to bestow awards based on visitors' votes. Sierra Nevada *Pale Ale* got the first prize, while Sierra Nevada's and Anchor's porters got the second and third places.)
