### The Chronicles of the Catastrophe

The first half of the 20th century, with all the wars, depressions, and prohibition laws, was a long-lasting shock for beer-makers. The result of the shock was an unprecedented consolidation and even a monopolization of the brewing industry. The number of independent beer producers started its free fall at the beginning of the 20th century and eventually decreased several dozen times by the 1980s[ref:poelmans-swinnen-economic-history:20]() [ref:{"short":"Dijk, M., Kroezen, J., Slob, B. (2018)","extra":"From Pilsner Desert to Craft Beer Oasis: The Rise of Craft Brewing in the Netherlands"}:10](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321947981_From_Pilsner_Desert_to_Craft_Beer_Oasis_The_Rise_of_Craft_Brewing_in_the_Netherlands).

Those countries that hadn't had extensive beer traditions of their own, might still have the two-producers duopoly as of today, and some markets (like South African, Turkish, or Colombian) are dominated by a single company controlling more than 70% of the entire beer production[ref:{"source":{"alias":"howard-globalization","short":"Howard, P.H. (2013)","extra":"Too big to ale? Globalization and consolidation in the beer industry","href":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2268705"}}:4]().

The natural result of the consolidation was that not only the producers' number collapsed but also the number of available beer styles as well — e.g. the entire assortment was reduced to pale and dark lagers only (plus unfiltered varieties, sometimes). Even in Belgium, the market share of lagers was 55% as early as 1928, and since then it increased up to 70%[ref:hallen-belgian-industry:23](). In the United States, 101 breweries were producing just two porters in 1970[ref:{"short":"Jankowski, B. (2012)", "extra":"American Porters"}](https://www.morebeer.com/articles/american_porters) and one IPA[ref:steele-ipa:"6":]().

One of the notable exceptions was the United Kingdom, where lagers were losing to bitters and stouts up until the 1990s — although, it didn't prevent the industry from being monopolized: in the 1980s, the six largest brewers produced 75% of all beer in the country and controlled almost every pub[ref](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmtrdind/128/12805.htm).

One of the moving forces of the lagerization and the consolidation was the incessant process of mergers and acquisitions that had finally culminated in creating the global beer conglomerate AB InBev, which consumed American Annheuser-Busch, Brazilian Ambev (which was in turn the joint venture of Brazilian brewers Antarctica and Brahma), and Belgian Interbrew (which was the result of the Artois-Pidboef merging), joined by SABMiller (which in turn was created after the SAB and Miller deal) in 2016. In some countries, the AB InBev market share exceeds 90% (for example, in Brazil and Uruguay) and even 99% (in the Dominican Republic)[ref](https://www.nbwa.org/resources/look-inside-global-beer-market).

This company — as well as the smaller conglomerates: Heineken N.V., Carlsberg Group, MillerCoors, and China Resources Snow Breweries Ltd. — owns literally hundreds of beer brands. Does it worth mentioning that almost all of these brands are totally identical pale lagers that the consumers aren't able to distinguish one from another[ref:howard-globalization:2]()? In 2012, the four largest brewing companies in the world controlled 70% of the income in the industry[ref:howard-globalization:1]() — the unprecedented digits that surpassed even those from the London porter oligopoly times.

#### First they ignore you

This story, of the rebirth of the brewing out of ashes, in defiance of the industry giants, valued many billions of dollars each, is spectacular per se. But the fact that it was started *by one single person* makes it truly extraordinary.

Of course, events of such a magnitude never happen because of someone's individual efforts only: the changes build up for decades thanks to many people and are finally realized with the help of thousands and millions of enthusiasts. But the fact still is: for eleven years, from 1965 to 1976, there was exactly one man at the world's craft scene.

Frederick Louis ‘Fritz’ Maytag III was born in Newton, Iowa, in 1937 in a family of hereditary entrepreneurs. His great-grandfather, Frederick Louis Maytag, was the founder of the Maytag corporation that was making house appliances (washing machines, first of all). His father, Frederick Louis Maytag II, founded the Maytag Dairy Farm company that was producing dairy products. The hero of this story founded the craft revolution (though never yearned to do something like this).

In August, 1965, ‘the smallest of the 50 US breweries’, the Anchor Brewing Company, was scheduled to be closed. (As we remember, there were 101 breweries in the US; but there were just 50 independent companies that owned them.) Anchor was producing a specialty beer: the so-called ‘American Steam Beer’, which is made by forcing lager yeasts to ferment at a higher temperature. This style was considered to be a traditional American one (one might even say ‘California common’) and was enjoying some limited popularity among the frequenters (one of whom was Maytag) of the ‘Old Spaghetti Factory’ bar in San Francisco. As Fritz would later tell, he wasn't actually very fond of *steam beer*: it was rather a concept of traditional local beverage that attracted him[ref](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-03-10-tm-45141-story.html).

After learning from the bar owner that the *steam beer* production was to shut down, Maytag bought 51% of the shares (eventually increased up to 100% in 1965) — which cost him like a used car, as Fritz later admitted. This decision was, if not exactly spontaneous, at least very optimistic. First, Maytag had no idea of how to run the brewery; second, the business health of the Anchor Brewing Company was somewhere in-between intensive care and the morgue. Thousands of decisions like that in the 20th-century world had ended ingloriously — with bankruptcy and a fresh grave in the cemetery of history.

Anchor was doomed, as it had no chance to compete against the giants that were producing predictable and understandable lagers at a colossal scale. Anchor beer wasn't even bottled, the quality left a lot to be desired, and the entire sales network comprised several local bars. While an average American brewery in 1965 was producing more than 5 million liters of beer per month[ref:poelmans-swinnen-economic-history:20](), for the same period Anchor could brew… 100 kegs.

So, how was Maytag able not only to save the brewery but to make it a rival to giants?

First, he took the task of organizing beer production seriously and created a ‘laboratory’ on Eighth Street. Cheap substitutes, like corn syrup, were dropped and the beer taste was improved (surprisingly, by returning to the original, e.g. the 19th-century, recipe!), and, most importantly, the Maytag's team managed to achieve a decent shelf life without employing preservatives.

Second, Anchor started to work for its consumer: selling bottled versions, and not only in local bars but across the entire country as Maytag had found distributors for the product. The company used to grasp any marketing possibility to promote the beer.

And third, with his relentless advocacy and passion for the beer ‘alchemy’, Fritz Maytag encouraged many people to rebel against the world of identical pale lagers. California gradually became the center of what was later named ‘the craft revolution’: many other beer enthusiasts started to open their microbreweries inspired by Maytag and the Anchor Brewing Company example[ref:{"source":{"alias":"acitelli-audacity","short":"Acitelli, T. (2013)","extra":["The Audacity of Hops: the History of America’s Craft Beer Revolution","ISBN 9781613743881"]}}:"‘The Last Shall Be First’":]().

#### How to taste

Though Maytag sold the Anchor Brewing Company in 2010, his work lives on. The American steam beer aka the California common is being made by many small independent breweries (just like Fritz was dreaming of): American Toppling Goliath, Widmer Brothers, Smuttynose, Port City Brewing, and European Mikkeler and To Øl. Of course, ‘Anchor Steam’ should be considered the canonical one.

#### On ‘craft’ and ‘The Craft Revolution’

In the previous chapters, we had used the phrase ‘craft breweries’ quite a handful of times, and this part of the book will be exclusively dedicated to them, so it would be nice to actually define ‘craft’ before telling its history.

Alas, it's not that simple. Early craft brewers were defining themselves through quality: we make better beer and do not use cheap ingredients. But as we all understand, it's not entirely true: a brewery is a commercial venture which has to economize; the question is just where the borderline is, e.g. which cost-saving practices are acceptable and which are not.

Later, the ‘microbrewery’ term emerged, and beers made by these small independent producers became the ‘craft’ ones. But this definition is outdated as well, as many craft brewers had built real factories since then and their output is now pretty impressive. Also, many of them are not independent: some were sold to giant corporations (like the Anchor Brewing Company that Maytag ceded to Sapporo Holdings) or were from the beginning special ‘craft’ branches of such enterprises (like the Blue Moon Brewing Co. that was launched by MillerCoors).

Today, the best definition of ‘craft’ is a ‘subculture’: the subculture of people who value and appreciate interesting (to them) beers.
