### New Belgium

As strange as it may sound, American craft brewers, indefatigable in their rally to recreate classic British recipes, had ignored for a quite some time the tradition of another ‘beer Mecca’: Belgium. By the early 90s, the only Belgian-style ale produced in the US was Redhook Ale and its creation was quite anecdotical. Yeasts for the new ale of 1982 were borrowed from the University of Washington. They gave the beer a cloying overripe-banana taste. Consumers thought the beer simply spoiled. It was Michael Jackson, the beer writer, who saved the business by designating the Redhook product ‘Belgian-style ale,’ as they soon thereafter advertised[ref:hindy-revolution:"1":]().

The real advent of a Belgian tradition on American soil is tied to the name of Jeff Lebesch. Jeff was an electrical engineer and one of Papazian's first pupils when Charlie was giving homebrewing master classes (by the way, illegal at that time) in his kitchen. In 1988, Lebesch realized his old dream. Inspired by Jackson, he spent a his vacation traveling Belgium by bike, guided by Jackson's almanac. From this journey, he brought back a journal full of notes on Belgian brewing, and a firm determination to make Belgian-style beers of his own. In 1991, Josh and his wife Kim Jordan launched a craft startup in the basement of their Fort Collins home. The logo of the new brewery featured a bike, and the first beer they made was named ‘Fat Tire.’ It was an amber ale in the *Spéciale Belge* style (see the corresponding chapter). Soon, Lebesch started to brew a second beer, ‘Abbey’, in the Trappist *dubbel* style.

New Belgium Brewing Company was an instant success. In 1993, ‘Abbey’ was awarded a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival - in the ‘Various, Special’ category as nobody in the US has heard anything about ‘dubbel.’ Ten years later, the brewery was generating a fantastic (for craft brewing) 180 million dollars in annual sales.

Almost immediately, other ‘Belgian’ craft startups popped up: Canadian Unibroue was founded in 1993, Allagash Brewing Company in 1995, Brewery Ommegang and Russian River Brewing Company in 1997. Pierre Celis opened the Celis Brewery in 1992. He had moved to the US after selling Hoegaarden to Artois; though calling his *witbier* a traditional Belgian beer is rather a stretch (see the ‘Orange Zest, Coriander, and Pierre Celis’ chapter).

Interestingly, the boom of US ‘Belgian’ craft brewing preceded the boom of Belgian beer exports by a decade. Even in 2005, when New Belgium alone was producing 70 million liters of beer per year, real Belgian beer exports to the US comprised a modest 2 million liters, and it was mostly 'Stella Artois' and 'Jupiler' lagers[ref:belgian-beers-history-globalization:11, 34](). In fact, American craft brewers reinvented Belgian beer totally independently (as they did with British beers twenty years before that).

#### How to taste

The author of this book considers highly craft Belgian pale ales such as let's say, 'Gnommegang' by Brewery Ommegang or 'Damnation' by Russian River, a beer style in its own right, in some sense more ‘Belgian’ than real Belgian beers. Craft versions are more individually characteristic; the ‘Belgian’ traits are more extreme. We suggest readers draw their own conclusions.
