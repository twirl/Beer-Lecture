### American English

It was the beginning of the 1970s, and Anchor Brewing Company's situation remained uncertain. Maytag managed to make his enterprise profitable, but the necessity to expand and modernize the production lines forced him to increasingly draw from his savings. In search of additional sources of income, Fritz decided to enrich his beer assortment, and his attention logically fell upon another beer style with deep roots in American soil: porter. In 1974, he brewed the first batch of “Anchor Porter.” That same year, Maytag traveled to Great Britain and with some amusement learned that porter had not been produced in Great Britain for two decades already; we may remember this from the “Beer of the Industrial Revolution” chapter: [ref:acitelli-audacity:"“The Most Influential Beer”":]()! (Later, Anchor would add pale ale to the roster, and after that, barleywine* — two typical English beers).

Meanwhile, the winds of change steadily blew in California, and other enthusiasts joined Maytag. In 1976, New Albion Brewery opened — the first brewery since Prohibition  (formally, a winery: since at the same time homebrewing was still banned in the US). Jack McAuliffe was deeply impressed by British beers which he had developed a taste for during overeas military service. He had visited Maytag's Anchor Brewing Company and with enthusiastic inspiration convinced Susie Stern and Jane Zimmermann to invest in a brewing startup. The three of them created the second craft brewery in the world, located in the town of Sonoma, California — as they couldn't afford San Francisco rent rates.

The New Albion founders considered American beer “a national disgrace.” It all tasted the same and to make production cheaper, the major manufacturers were shameless in their use of preservatives, cheap grain substitutes, stabilizers, and a multitude of the most recent developments in food chemistry. McAuliffe declared his goal was to make *quality* beers equal to the best English ales. The startup's limited funding forced them to literally build everything from scratch — fermentation tanks were refurbished 200-liter Coca Cola syrup barrels, labels were glued to bottles manually with the vintage mechanical device made in 1910, etc. nonetheless, the startup founders had achieved their goal[ref:acitelli-audacity:"“Chez McAuliffe”":]().

New Albion Brewery started to make porter as well (and other English specialties such as stout and pale ale), thus completing the passing of the baton. While English breweries stagnated, their famous porters and Burton ales disappearing, the Americans began rebuilding the tradition.

The years 1975 to 1980 turned out to be the tipping point in the history of craft brewing. Several important events happened within this timeframe:
  * CAMRA organized the first Great British Beer Festival in 1975.
  * New Albion Brewery opened in 1976.
  * Inspired by CAMRA, the British beer enthusiast and first contemporarty beer historian, Michael Jackson (not the pop singer!), on the heels of raising public interest in ales, [ref:zythophile:"Michael Hardman MBE – Mighty Beer Enthusiast"](https://zythophile.co.uk/2008/12/31/michael-hardman-mbe-mighty-beer-enthusiast/), issued the first edition of his famous “World Guide to Beer” in 1977.
  * US Homebrewing was officially re-legalized in 1978. The same year, amateur brewers came out of hiding and thanks to the efforts of Charlie Papazian, the American Homebrewers Association was founded. The homebrewer's journal “Zymurgy” and the first recipe almanac “Joy of Brewing” were issued.
  * A year later, the US held its first national homebrewing competition[ref:{"source":{"alias":"hindy-revolution","short":"Hindy, S. (2014)","extra":["The Craft Beer Revolution. How a Band of Microbrewers Is Transforming the World”s Favorite Drink","ISBN 9781137278760"]}}:"2":]().
  * Finally, two more craft breweries opened in California (DeBakker Brewing Company and California Steam). Two more opened in other states: in Boulder, Colorado (simply named Boulder Brewing Company) and in Albany, New York (William S. Newman Brewing Company)[ref:acitelli-audacity:"“The Fireman and the Goat Shed”":]().

The advanced degrees and professional occupations of almost every newly established brewer had nothing to do with beer. McAuliffe, an ex-submarine crewman, worked as an optical engineer. Two of the Boulder Brewing founders, David Hummer and Randolf Ware, were astrophysics teachers. Papazian was a school teacher as well. Zimmermann later became a distinguished therapist.

Still, what did all of them offer to the American beer lover? What we know as the British specialties:
  * Boulder was brewing bitters, stouts, and porters[ref](https://www.craftbeer.com/featured-brewery/this-is-40-boulder-beer); 
  * DeBakker brewed porter[ref](https://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/new-albion-vintage-beer-tasting/);
  * The first issue of “Zymurgy” featured the recipes of “Vagabond Black "gingered" Ale” and “Black Lava Ale”[ref](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-community-culture/zymurgy-magazine-issue-1-throwback-to-1978/);
  * The first National Homebrew Competition bestowed awards in four categories: beers and lagers, ales, stouts, and “unusual brews”[ref](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-community-culture/zymurgy-magazine-issue-1-throwback-to-1978/).
  * Bill Newman was producing cask ales in the English manner, and buying UK hops[ref](https://ediblecapitaldistrict.ediblecommunities.com/drink/bill-newman-godfather-american-craft-brewing).

#### How to taste

Alas, none of the craft startups have survived until today. DeBakker and California Steam were short-lived. New Albion closed in 1982. Despite gaining great authority among homebrewers, McAuliffe, Stern, and Zimmermann were unable to build a sustainable business. However, they made a definitive impact on future craft brewing by vividly demonstrating how a private microbrewery might be founded and launched — without buying a whole factory. More precisely, they *had invented* microbrewing as a modern concept. Boulder Brewing Company even went public in 1980 but declared bankruptcy a decade later (and was re-launched then as Boulder Beer Company). Wm. S. Newman Brewing Company held on longer than others but closed in 1993.

Still, the American porter remains one of the most popular craft beer styles. Maytag and McAuliffe brought American boldness to the brew. Unlike the Brits, Americans porters are more complex, aromatic, and even daring. They experiment a lot with ingredients and recipe. Unrestrained, one might say.

With the New Albion, DeBakker, and Boulder versions no longer available, the most worthy challenge is to find Anchor Porter. Of course, any self-respecting American brewery has one in its portfolio nowadays. The experts value greatly, for example, “Everett Porter” and “Twilight Of The Idols” by Hill Farmstead, “Maple Bacon Coffee Porter” and “Last Snow” by Funky Buddha, “Edmund Fitzgerald” by Great Lakes, “Black Butte Porter” by Deschutes, etc.
