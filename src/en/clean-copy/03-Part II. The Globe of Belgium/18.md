### March

“Lambic,” “faro,” and “gueuze” were evolving terms and somewhat interchangeable in their meaning but still referred to the same production methods. With “march” beer it's more complicated. 'March' was used to denote different beverages that had one common feature — the timing. The first month of spring was traditionally considered to be the best time for brewing, as stable low temperatures allowed for making the finest beer. In Belgium, they used the “march” designations (“Mars,” “Meert,” “bière de Mars”) for cellared beers — aged for 4 to 6 months: weak lambics and so-called “saisons” (or “bière de garde”).[ref:{"source":{"alias":"hors-categorie","short":"Janssen, D.","extra":"Hors Catégorie Brewing","href":"http://www.horscategoriebrewing.com"}}:"Biere de Mars (the lambic version) and Lambic in the mid 1800s (part 1)"](http://www.horscategoriebrewing.com/2015/11/biere-de-mars-lambic-version-and-lambic.html) The main difference between the lambics and “saisons” was that the former were fully fermented spontaneously, absorbing the “wild” airborne microorganisms, while the latter first received standard yeasts, then surrendering to the “bretts” after primary fermentation.

(There is also a German “march” beer — *Märzen* — but it's a lager.)

The first *saisons* were brewed in Liège at least from the beginning of the 19th century. Liège saison was dry, relatively strong, and, as a typical product of the period, contained a large proportion of spelt malt and unmalted wheat. At the end of the century, saisons became popular in Charleroi and other towns of the Hainaut province, though the word did not strictly refer to a specific style, but rather just a cellaring beer in general: darker beer could be marked as “bruin saison” as well.[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"What was a 19th century saison really like?"](https://lostbeers.com/what-was-a-19th-century-saison-really-like/)

However, it later had a more specific meaning: pale cellaring beer (implying mixed fermentation, partially fermented with “bretts”), dry, and made from barley and wheat. Closer to the end of the century it became almost indistinguishable from “grisette” — initially, cheap dark beer for miners.

#### How to Taste It

Three companies have continuously brewed saison for more than a hundred years. They are:

  * Brasserie à Vapeur with their Saison de Pipaix
  * Brasserie de Silly with Silly Saison
  * Martens from Limburg that produces a bunch of “Sezoens” beers.

The Brasserie à Vapeur is also notable for the 19th-century Watt steam engine that still powers all the mechanisms in the brewery. (The words “à Vapeur” literally mean “steam-powered.”)

Many other Belgian breweries are making saisons nowadays, most notably Fantôme Saison and Saison Dupont. Among craft brewers, Hill Farmstead and Two Side Project have made saisons their specialties. French versions of the style known as “bière de garde” are being produced by Brasserie 3 MONTS and Brasserie Duyck, to name a few.

*Grisette* also enjoys some demand, though it's rather hard to observe any major differences between modern saison and grisette.

#### Seasonal confusion

And one more thing: saison turned out to be the primary victim of dilettante historians. Nearly everything written about it (both online and offline) is untrue. If you research information on this beer style, you will learn that it was made by farmers during winter and spring using their own grain to be consumed by seasonal workers in the summer and autumn months, and that it was a typical beer from the Hainaut province. In fact, it was quite the opposite[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"Fact check: Yvan De Baets on saison (and the results may shock you)"](https://lostbeers.com/fact-check-yvan-de-baets-on-saison-and-the-results-may-shock-you/):

  * First, the beer was made by professional brewers from commerical grain; saisons were actively sold to other regions and countries, and even participated in international expos and competitions.
  * Second, its origins in Hainaut began much later than in other regions; “saison” beer was known in Liège from at least 1832, while the oldest mention of making it in Hainaut comes from 1858.

Lastly, the Lacambre treatise doesn't mention any farmhouse production of saisons. In 1851, “saison” meant Liège beer made from spelt and wheat in winter or early spring, aged 4-6 months (if the beer was brewed in March itself, it was aged until the end of the year).[ref:lacambre:376-378]()

Despite the fact that literally no evidence suggests that *saisons* were brewed by farmers, the entire category of these mixed-fermented beers is now known as “farmhouse ale.” And *grisette* is told to be “a saison for miners,” whatever the unlikely origin of this tale.
