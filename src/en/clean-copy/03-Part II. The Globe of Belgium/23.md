### The White Cap

After *dubbel* was established, Westmalle carried on. In the 1920s and 30s the Trappists closely cooperated with civilian brewer specialists, most notably with Hendrik Verlinden. He was a writer and beer expert who promoted the scientific approach to brewing beer in general and yeast selection in particular. After the First World War ended, yet another wave of pale lager offensives on Belgian soil began, and Verlinden was one of those who sought an alternative. In collaboration with the Westmalle monks, he created a beer style that was later called “tripel” (sometimes spelled as “triple” or “trippel”). This style elaborated on light abbey ale with an increased alcohol content (typically, around 8%) with the *dubbel* technique of adding *candi sugar* and conducting secondary fermentation in bottles. Like *dubbel*, *tripel* is highly drinkable as it isn't as thick as comparable strong beers like *barleywine* or imperial stout.

Verlinden released his own tripel under the “Witcap Pater” brand in 1932, and that was the single case wherein monks allowed a civilian to borrow the “Trappist beer” designation. Westmalle released their version of tripel, named “Superbier,” one year later in 1933. In 1956, Superbier was renamed simply 'Tripel.' At this exact time, the first and only correction of the recipe occurred: brother Thomas decided to add more hops to *tripel*. Since then, the “Westmalle Tripel” recipe has never changed.[ref:brew-like-a-monk:71-73]()

#### How to taste

Both original versions of *tripel* are still produced. “Witcap Pater” is now made as “Witcap Tripel” by the Slaghmuylder family brewery and Westmalle Tripel is still being prepared under the Abbey of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart monks' control. Other Trappist breweries are making *tripel* as well: Chimay, La Trappe, and Tre Fontane, though the last one is rather far from the “golden standard” of Brother Thomas.' St. Bernardus, Achel (as Achel 8° Blond), and Cardeña also make it.

Of course, many civilian brewers, both Belgian (Duvel Moortgat Maredsous 10, Gouden Carolus Tripel, etc.) and American (Unibroue La Fin Du Monde, Allagash Curieux, New Belgium Brewing Company Trippel, Samuel Adams New World Tripel, etc.), produce *tripel* as well.

Also, an interesting variation of *tripel* under the brand name “Tripel Karmeliet” was introduced in 1996 by the Belgian Bosteels brewery (owned by AB InBev). They claim that the recipe, dated back to 1679, was found in the Carmelite monastery, and is solely unique from the Trappist *tripel*. It is perhaps a bit of *market deception*: though the historical recipe does exist, and includes the same proportion of barley, wheat, and oats as used in “Tripel Karmeliet” production, no pale ales or bottle conditioning could have been known in 17th-century Belgium. Nonetheless, it is still a very interesting (and tasty!) beer.
