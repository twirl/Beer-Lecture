### Spéciale Belge

Apart from its rich history and peculiar legislation, one more factor contributed heavily to the Belgian beer heritage: the Belgians are persistent, stubborn even, in preserving their national tradition.

During the last decade of the 19th century, with the intimidating advance of foreign beers and German lagers in particular — beer imports more than tripled from 1891 to 1903, — Belgian citizens hadn't sat on their hands. In 1901, the Union of Belgian Brewers put forth the idea of creating a national beer style that would compete with Munich, Pilsen, and Dortmund lagers (and also British ales). Cooperating with the Belgian brewery schools association, they agreed to a national competition in 1904 and announce the winners at the 1905 World Expo to be held in Liège.

Accounting for the capabilities of the local brewing industry as well as the realities of the time, the organizers determined the guidelines thus: the new beer was to have an original gravity between 1.045 and 1.050 (which implies around 5% ABV) and cost 15 to 25 centimes per glass. Initially, these requirements met widespread criticism as they were uncharacteristic for the period (the typical gravity of the end-19th century Belgian beers was much less than that). However, the organizers stuck by their decision: the new beer must comply with modern lager and bitter parameters. History has proven they were absolutely right\![ref:{"source":{"alias":"steen-speciale","short":"Van den Steen, J. (2016)","extra":["Ale Speciale Belge", "ISBN 9401405867"]}}:15-16]()

All in all, 73 breweries participated in the contest. The winner was *Belge du Faleau* by Brasserie Binard from Châtelineau, and the style became known as “the Belgian special” (*Spéciale Belge*). It was a light warm-fermented amber beer, made from slightly roasted pale malt. Soon, many other breweries started to imitate the style.[ref:{"source":{"alias":"belgian-beers-history-globalization","short":"Persyn, D., Swinnen, J.F.M., Vanormelingen, S.

#### How to Taste It

Today, *Spéciale Belge* is a protected “regional product” designation given to just five beers.[ref](https://www.streekproduct.be/weetjes/amberkleurige-speciale-belge-ale-bieren-behoren-tot-onze-rijke-biertraditie) Four of them have been in production for a century or more:

  * *Spécial* De Ryck and Contreras *Tonneke*, both made since 1920.
  * The Belgian special by the Palm Breweries, which is simply marked *Palm* — probably, the most canonical one.
  * The famous *Bolleke* by Brouwerij De Koninck — the iconic beer from Antwerp; produced since 1925, it was known as simply *De Koninck* until the 2019 rebranding (originally, *bolleke* was a brand-name of De Koninck glassware).
  * The last one is *Spéciale De Poes* made by the modern brewery Brouwerij De Poes.
