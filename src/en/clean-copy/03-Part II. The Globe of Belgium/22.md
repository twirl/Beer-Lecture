### Not Brewers

Before we continue on to the next Belgian beer style, we must make a journey into the distant past. Let us remind the reader that in the early Middle Ages King Charlemagne (through the efforts of his heir, King Louis the Pious) promoted the Rule of St. Benedict in his kingdom. The monks of this order were known as “the Benedictines.”

However, several centuries later, some theologians began to express their dissatisfaction with the liberties the Benedictines allowed themselves. In 1098, the Cistercians emerged — those who strictly and obediently adhered to *what they perceived* Benedict of Nursia's mandate to be.

However, several centuries later, some theologians began to express their dissatisfaction with the liberties the Cistercians allowed themselves. In 1664, the founder of the La Trappe monastery in France, Armand-Jean de Rancé, further reformed the cloister's way of life. He introduced the strictest rules: mandatory hard physical labor, the vow of silence, a spartan diet, and isolation from the outside world. Rancé's followers started to call themselves the Cistercians of the *Strict Observance*, or the Trappists (after the La Trappe monastery).

In 1790, during the course of the French Revolution, monastery property was secularized, and the French-led abbeys, including the Trappist ones, were disbanded. Monks initially moved to Switzerland, but, during the Napoleonic Wars, almost all Swiss, Dutch, Belgian, and German abbeys were disbanded, if not destroyed. Friars were able to return to their customary lifestyle only after Bonaparte's fall, when they rebuilt their monasteries — both in France and abroad. La Trappe itself came under the Brotherhood's control in 1815 and was reconsecrated in 1832.

Throughout their history, the Trappists have brewed their own beer (and made their own cheese) as they were very strict about fasting. So it may not be surprising that they started to build breweries in all the newly created or restored monasteries. In 1836, the brewery at the **Abbey of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in Westmalle** opened, and another in 1839, at the **St. Sixtus' Abbey in Westvleteren**. Both abbeys were located in the territories that became parts of the newly created Kingdom of Belgium. During the 19th century, the Trappists built or restored many other monasteries, and several of them started to brew beer. Some percentage of the output was sold in the local vicinity (for example, in 1870, the physicians praised the strong beer from the **Scourmont Abbey in Chimay** for its curative properties).[ref:{"source":{"alias":"brew-like-a-monk","short":"Hieronymus, S. (2005)","extra":["Brew Like a Monk: Trappist, Abbey, and Strong Belgian Ales and How to Brew Them","ISBN 093738187X"]}}:33]() Historically speaking, however, the influence of Trappist brewing (and monastic brewing as a whole) in Belgium was negligible. For example, Lacambre didn't mention any abbey beers.

Despite being an isolated community, the monks nevertheless kept pace with technical progress. Particularly, Father Dominic from the **Abbey of Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy in Rochefort** studied in Leuven, and at the beginning of the 20th century even won several medals in brewing competitions.[ref:brew-like-a-monk:36]()

#### The Specificities of the Belgian Prohibition

Soon, however, Belgian beer diversity suffered two crushingly hard blows in a row. First, during the First World War, many breweries were closed, their equipment confiscated, and production banned. Second, after the war, Belgium adopted its prohibition law.

The regulation of 1919 was primarily aimed at *jenever* and other strong alcoholic beverages. It was prohibited to sell them in bars and other public places. Still, the consumption of beer, which was heavily taxed, dropped dramatically as well. The law was strict, however *imperfect*. It did not take into account how strong a beer was (probably because a typical Belgian beer from that time had quite modest alcohol content, around 3% ABV). As a consequence, the demand increased for strong beers (including monastic ones).

In 1922, the monks from Westmalle literally invented a new type of beer which they called “dubbel.” It's rather hard to explain this phenomenon — of all Belgian and world brewers, why was it monks who defined the new fashion? What they created is considerably more “craft” beer than many contemporary *products*.

Technologically speaking, *dubbel* is a dark beer with an addition of caramel syrup (“candi sugar” — not to be confused with raw sugar chunks that are called “rock candy” by Americans) to the wort, and fermented twice. After the primary fermentation is finished, fresh yeasts and more syrup are added, and the future beer is bottled for the secondary fermentation. Undisputedly, all the elements taken individually were already known — dark beer, syrup, yeasts, bottle conditioning, etc. — but, as a whole, the process is a unique invention having no direct predecessors.

The result of this double fermentation is a rather strong (initially the strength was around 5% ABV, then it gradually reached 7%), soft, full-bodied, and surprisingly smooth beer — a signature product of Belgian monastic brewing.

#### How to Taste It

The Abbey of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart continues producing this beer under the *Westmalle Dubbel* brand. Apart from it, five other Trappist monasteries brew *dubbel*:

  * the Scourmont Abbey with *Chimay Rouge* beer
  * the Abbey of Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy with *Rochefort 6*
  * the St. Sixtus' Abbey with *Westvleteren 8*
  * the **Koningshoeven Abbey**, under the brand name *La Trappe Dubbel*
  * the **Engelszell Abbey** (*Stift Engelszell Benno*).

Of course, many secular brewers are making *dubbel* as well. First of all, we should mention *Pater 6* by St. Bernardus. Westvleteren monks outsourced the beer production to this brewery that prepared it for the monasteries from 1946 to 1992 (and physically located on the street called “Trappistenweg”). Another one, *Achel 8° Bruin*, was produced by the **Saint Benedictus-Abbey in Achel**, but the brewery had lost the Trappist logo as the monastery itself closed (though, the Abbot of Westmalle comes to Achel once a week to oversee the production).

Apart from those, we might mention Belgian *dubbel* by Corsendonk (*Pater*), Duvel Moortgat (*Maredsous 8 Brune*), Grimbergen, Bornem (*Double*), Affligem, Petrus, Val-Dieu (*Brune*), St. Feuillien (*Brune*). Of course, American craft brewers that specialize in Belgian beers are making it as well: Unibroue (*Maudite*), Ommegang (*Abbey Ale*), Allagash, and others.

#### Strict Observance

There is a big difference between real Trappist beers and those who imitate them. To have a right to the “Authentic Trappist Logo” sign, three conditions must be fulfilled:

  * The beer is to be brewed within the Trappist monastery walls by the monks themselves or under their supervision.
  * Brewing must be a secondary occupation and must not affect the monastic way of living.
  * The venture must not make any profit as any income above the monastery's needs shall go to charity.

The Saint Sixtus Abbey in Westvleteren even forbids re-selling their beers. They must be bought in the monastery for a fixed price. The bottles have no labels (which of course does not stop profiteers from smuggling them; today, the bottles with the recognizable caps might be bought in many large cities). The Westvleteren monks even had a motto: “We are not brewers. We are monks. We brew beer to be able to afford being monks.” As time passed, it became more laconic: “We brew to live, not live to brew.”

Today, Trappist monks are usually indirectly involved in brewing, taking a supervisory role in the process. In most monasteries, the head brewer position is occupied by a civilian manager (though it was monks who established the basics — let's say that Father Theodor from Chimay had selected the yeast strains suitable for making monastic beers with his own hand). Still, running a Trappist brewery *implies restrictions*. Jacques Petre, the former head of the Orval brewery, described the contradictions: “Before anything happens, you have to explain it to the monks, you have to explain it to the board, you have to explain it to the workers, you have to explain it to everybody. It takes time, and for a monk time doesn't exist in the way it does for most people.”

When Trappist beers gained popularity, many brewers, both conscientious and not-so-conscientious, started marking their beers as “Trappist” to exploit the monasteries' reluctance to increase the output. The monks, who were always very zealous regarding the quality of the product sold in their name, organized the International Trappist Association in 1997 and codified the aforementioned rules for obtaining the “Authentic Trappist Product” logo.

Initially, the Association comprised eight abbeys: 
  * Orval, Chimay, Westvleteren, Rochefort, Westmalle, and Achel in Belgium
  * Koningshoeven in the Netherlands (sells beer under the “La Trappe” trademark)
  * Mariawald in Germany (though it has already ceased production at that time).

Today, there are 20 abbeys in the Association, of which 11 brew Authentic Trappist beers. Apart from the above-mentioned, they are:
  * The monasteries of **Zundert** in the Netherlands and Engelszell in Austria
  * The **Abbey of Saints Vincent and Anastasius** in Italy (makes the *Tre Fontane* beers)
  * The **Mount St Bernard Abbey in England** (the *Tynt Meadow* brand).

Three more breweries sell beer but have no rights to the logo: 
  * The above-mentioned Achel
  * Mont des Cats in France (beers under this brand are actually brewed by Chimay)
  * Cardeña in Spain (the production site is located outside of the monastery, which is disallowed by the rules).
  
One more brewery — once run by the **St. Joseph Abbey in Spencer**, USA — had been making Trappist beers for eight years and was closed in May 2022.

By the way, the Association members also produce many other Trappist products: bread, yeasts, soap, chocolate, cookies, honey, jam, liquors, mushrooms, olive oil, wine, cheese, and many other things, from ceramic jugs to canned quinces from monastery gardens.
