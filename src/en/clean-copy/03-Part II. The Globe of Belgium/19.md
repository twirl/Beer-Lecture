### Turning Red

Our knowledge of the third authentic Belgian beer style, the Flanders brown, is even more scattered than data on *lambic* and *saison*, given that the latter has been pieced together, bit by bit. The first known mention of the Flanders brown comes from the recipe omnibus of 1829. It reveals only that the beer was all barley malt beer and that it was boiled for a long time (from 15 to 30 hours) to achieve a characteristic brown color.[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"A small history of Flemish old brown (and red) – 1"](https://lostbeers.com/a-small-history-of-flemish-old-brown-and-red-1/). Lacambre's treatise additionally specifies that the beer was ready to consume after two or three months' conditioning[ref:lacambre:312](), which makes the Flanders brown another kind of cellar ale (which could imply additional fermentation with “bretts”)

Even the 1879 recipe book merely reiterates Lacambre's words; apparently, the Flanders brown was but a local variety of “brown” beer of little interest to the wider public. However, in the 1880s the situation changed dramatically. The style became immensely popular thanks to the efforts of Eugène Rodenbach from Roeselare. After completing his training in England, the young Rodenbach became a partner in the family brewery (which belonged to his father, Edward) and refurbished it in accordance with the latest British production trends. Specifically, he started to leave the beer for additional maturation in large wooden barrels called “foeders” (often those that previously housed wine, cherry brandy, cognac, or other grape-based alcoholic drinks).[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"A small history of Flemish old brown (and red) – 1"](https://lostbeers.com/a-small-history-of-flemish-old-brown-and-red-1/). Some sources claim the idea was borrowed from the Greene King brewers that are still producing similar-looking beer[ref:{"source":{"alias":"bailey-pauls-beer","short":"Bailey, P.","extra":["Paul's Beer & Travel Blog"],"href":"https://baileysbeerblog.blogspot.com"}}:"Rodenbach Brewery"](https://baileysbeerblog.blogspot.com/2015/09/rodenbach-brewery.html)

Interestingly, until the 1880s, Rodenbach beer was considered an *uitzet*, and it  likely became acknowledged as a separate beer style largely due to Eugène's improvements. Consumers developed a taste for the new recipe, and at the beginning of the 20th century, local producers started to replicate it. The most successful were the brewers from Oudenaarde: their beers were hailed as equal to wine.[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"A small history of Flemish old brown (and red) – 2"](https://lostbeers.com/a-small-history-of-flemish-old-brown-and-red-2/) (an unprecedented compliment to beer!) The beer-makers took this designation as a compliment, using it extensively in their advertisements, even adopting the motto “It's wine!”

From the 1880s until now, Rodenbach beers are made utilizing the following process[ref](http://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Flemish_Red-Brown_Beer#Microbes_and_Flavor_Compounds):
  * During the first seven days, primary fermentation is carried out with regular baker's yeasts (though the microorganisms package used in the brewery comprises several quite specific S. cerevisiae strains as well as several other species of *Saccharomyces* class and some *Lactobacillus*);
    * Unlike *lambics*, the Flanders brown at this stage contains no traces of *Enterobacteria* and acetic acid bacteria, which results in lower acidity.

  * Then the working beer is transferred into the vessels for secondary fermentation to age for 4 to 5 weeks, wherein it is exposed to Lactobacillus (in particular, *Lactobacillus delbrueckii* subsp. *bulgaricus* which is used to make yogurts).
  * Then it's *foeder* time, where the beer undergoes the classical tertiary fermentation with *Brettanomyces*.
  * The final product is a blend of young and matured beers (other breweries might mix strong beer with a weak one, or with *lambic*).

Though the process of making it closely resembles the making of porter (which actually makes Rodenbach a better approximation of historical porter than modern beverages carrying this name), there are several important differences:
  * Porter-making requires a lot of hops, both for speeding up the maturation of the beer and for beating off unpleasant odors due to cheap raw materials while the Flemish brewers often use a minimal amount of hops so the resulting bitterness is below the threshold of human perception.
  * Malt gets the proper taste, aroma, and dark color with additional boiling for many hours (the tradition dating from the 18th century at least); the Rodenbachs, in particular, for a long time had been producing quality malt in their own malting kiln installed on the brewery grounds.

The resulting beverage is a largely well-balanced, with its acidity parameters indeed comparable to wine.

#### How to taste

The legacy of the founding fathers of Flanders brown is still thriving today. We're talking primarily about two breweries:

  * Rodenbach of Roeselare
  * Liefmans of Oudenaarde, with their Liefmans Oud Bruin.

Apart from Rodenbach and Liefmans, some other brewers have made Flanders brown since the 19th century:

  * Brouwerij Roman with their 'Adriaen Brouwer Audenaerds Bruyn' (a truly legendary brewery founded in 1545, and still run by the Roman family)
  * Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste with their 'Oud Bruin'; they also produce another popular (though relatively novel) variety of the style named 'Cuvée Des Jacobins'.

Alongside the historical brewers, there are several modern interpretations of this Flemish classic:

  * 'Bourgogne des Flandres' (made under Timmermans brand owned by John Martin Brewery)
  * 'Duchesse De Bourgogne' by Brouwerij Verhaeghe

Both names point to Burgundy, thus reminding us firstly when Belgium was a part of the Duchy of Burgundy in the 14-16th centuries, and secondly of Burgundian red wines.

And of course, many craft brewers produce this beer as well; the most popular ones are American: The Lost Abbey and Bruery Terreux.

#### What's in my name

If one closely peruses their beer labels, they will surely notice that it's usually “Flanders red” (“rood”) and not “brown” (“bruin”). However, in the 19th century it was just “brown,” with no other naming. It looks like the beer became “red” simply because the famous writer, beer enthusiast, and author of “The Great Beers of Belgium,” Michael Jackson (not to be confused with the famous singer) decided so.  The brewers had no other choice than to follow his lead.[ref:mulder-lost-beers:"Flemish brown, red or red brown? How Michael Jackson invented a beer style out of thin air"](https://lostbeers.com/flemish-brown-red-or-red-brown/) The division into “red” and “brown” varieties is now stated in the dictionaries and classifications, though no one can tell for sure if a difference in fact exists.
