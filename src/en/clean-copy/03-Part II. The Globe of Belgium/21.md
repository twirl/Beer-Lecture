### The Rose of Brussels

One more universally acclaimed beer style (a set of styles, to be precise) also tracks its history from the beginning of the 20th century: *fruit lambic*. We would likely not be far off base if we say that it's the most popular Belgian beverage in the world. Even those who hold scant interest in beer have heard something about fruited lambics.

Some sources claim that brewers used cherries in brewing during the 18th century[ref:lambic-info:"Kriek"](https://www.lambic.info/Kriek). However, those cherry beverages would have had limited popularity. Overall, there is no traceable continuous tradition. The oldest known recipe of *kriek lambic* was published in the “Petit Journal du Brasseur” in 1907 and required blending *lambic* in wooden barrels with macerated cherries for 4 to 5 months and then additionally maturing in bottles for at least half a year[ref:hors-categorie:"A Recipe for Kriek from 1907"](http://www.horscategoriebrewing.com/2018/10/a-recipe-for-kriek-from-1907.html). Though the style should have enjoyed some popularity at this point in time, it unlikely exceeds the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Two years later, raspberry beer came into play: the *framboise*. Paul Cantillon wrote that he had had more barrels of raspberry *lambic* than of cherry. Looks like the public's tastes were changing fast and unpredictably. This fashionable impetuousness continued so that *framboise* was already forgotten by the 1930s, and was restored only in 1973[ref:{"source":{"alias":"lambic-info","href":"https://www.lambic.info/","short":"Lambic.Info"}}:"Cantillon Rosé de Gambrinus"](https://www.lambic.info/Cantillon_Ros%C3%A9_de_Gambrinus).

Fruit *lambic* of the 1970s was much paler than the modern one and was often used as a cocktail base (for example, the mix with the strawberry liquor was known as “Kir Brussels”). Jean-Pierre Cantillon started experimenting with visuals, finally choosing  a gentle pink hue. In turn, it inspired Belgian watercolorist Raymon Coumans to draw a famous frivolous label for the beer, depicting a naked woman with skin the color of roses sitting on the lap of mythical king Gambrinus. Coumans made the artwork after taking Cantillon's word the beer would be renamed to Rosé De Gambrinus[ref:lambic-info:"Cantillon Rosé de Gambrinus"](https://www.lambic.info/Cantillon_Ros%C3%A9_de_Gambrinus).

Fun Fact: For the US market, the label was considered “indecent and obscene,” and Coumans had to cover the woman with a long light-blue dress — remarking “but most importantly, and the Americans need to know this, underneath the dress she”s in the buff.” Playboy Magazine even published an article, comparing the two variants of the label.

In the 1980s, with the Cantillon beer's popularity growing, *fruit lambic* had entered a Renaissance. Brewers started to make it using every kind of fruit available: peaches, black currant, grapes, strawberries, apples, bananas, pineapples, apricots, plums, blueberries, lemons, and even kiwifruits and cloudberries.

#### How to taste

It looks like the only *kriek* that existed before the 1980s is Cantillon Kriek. It's rather hard to find it, and it's a brave man's beverage as Cantillon doesn't sweeten their beers. Conversely, the only authentic *framboise* is Cantillon Rosé De Gambrinus.

Interestingly, the 1907 recipe recommends using not just any cherry but a very specific variety — that of Schaerbeek. Some brewers are nowadays producing *kriek* made specifically with the Schaerbeekse cherry:

  * '3 Fonteinen Schaerbeekse Kriek'
  * 'De Troch Oude Kriek'
  * 'Hanssens Scarenbecca Kriek'
  * 'Oud Beersel Schaarbeekse Oude Kriek'

The notable exclusion to the rule is none but Cantillon Kriek itself, which utilizes Turkish cherries. However, they still use the Schaerbeekse variety in their line-up under the “Lou Pepe” brand.

Fruited *lambic* is nowadays produced by many other breweries, both in Belgium and abroad. But be warned: the terms “kriek” and “framboise” are not protected designations, and the base beer could be anything. Many cheap “krieks” are actually sweetened lagers. Choose carefully and search for beers explicitly marked as “lambic.”
