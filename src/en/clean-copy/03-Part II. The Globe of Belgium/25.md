### Gradus ad Parnassum

The incremental development of Trappist beer, interrupted by the Second World War, resolutely continued where it left off. The new milestone is attributed to two other monasteries: the Scourmont Abbey in Chimay and the Abbey of Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy in Rochefort. While Chimay was founded by Westvleteren monks in 1854, the grandeur of Rochefort's history is comparable to Orval's only. Started in 1230, Gilles de Walcourt, Count of Rochefort, established a Cistercian nunnery in his lands. Like Orval, the Rochefort Abbey was plundered several times over subsequent epochs and dismantled during the Napoleonic era. Monks of Achel reconstructed the monastery in 1887.

Both abbeys recommenced brewing beer shortly after their restoration, and their products enjoyed some limited popularity (see the “Not Brewers” chapter). However, quantifiable success came after the War.

At that time, monks from Chimay, whose brewery was destroyed by the Germans, decided to rebuild a state-of-the-art facilty. To do so, Father Theodor went to Leuven to study with a famous professor Jean De Clerck (their cooperation lasted for more than four decades). After returning to the cloister in 1948, the Father enthusiastically proceeded in *enhancing* the monastic brews. With De Clerck's help, he isolated pure yeast strains and employed the *dubbel*-like bottle-conditioning technique. The red label beer from Chimay (“Chimay Rouge”) had quickly won customers' appreciation, and at the end of 1948 Father Theodor prepared an even stronger winter brew — with a blue label, “Chimay Bleue.”

Simultaneously, Rochefort also increased production, starting to sell their special strong beer, initially created for the sick and wounded during wartime. In 1949, the monks even procured a truck for delivery to nearby villages.

At this point, our story's heroes knocked their heads together. The growing popularity of high-quality (and stronger) Chimay beer caused Rochefort's sales to slump. However, let us remind you that both of them were monks first, not brewers, and as the Abbey of Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy's representatives had arrived in Chimay to ask for cessation of sales in Rochefort's vicinity, the Scourmont brothers proposed another solution; they would help to enhance Rochefort's beer quality. With the help of the Scourmont monks and again De Clerck's, the brewery was modernized and in 1952 a new beer was prepared in Rochefort, named “Merveille” (“The Miracle”). Later, the product range broadened as the “Rochefort 6” and “Rochefort 8” beers were added, and “Merveille” was renamed “Rochefort 10” (the number stood for the product's weeks of bottle-conditioning). At this point, Chimay “blue” ceased to be a “winter special” and became a regular part of the line-up from 1954 on. A bit later, “St. Bernardus 12” joined the lineup (and “Westvleteren XII” as well, after the St. Sixtus' Abbey reverted to brewing on-premises).[ref:brew-like-a-monk:48, 62-63]()

That is how at the beginning of the 1950s, a new type of Trappist beer was conceived: the extra-strong dark. “Chimay Bleue” had 9% ABV, while Rochefort 10 reached an imposing 11.3%. Unlike the less thick *dubbel*, this strength required numerous technological advancements: selecting suitable yeasts, increasing gravities, and adding more syrup. The resulting beer is extraordinarily drinkable for such gravity, featuring a rich and well-balanced taste.

The La Trappe brewers (who had always been much more market-oriented — to the extent they were once temporarily expelled from the Trappist association) started to make similarly styled beer in 1991. They named it “quadrupel” (sometimes shortened to *quad*) analagous to the *dubbel* and *tripel* styles. It created some confusion as it's not exactly clear at which point an “extra-strong dark ale” becomes a “quadrupel.” “Chimay Bleue” is usually considered the former, while “Rochefort 10” is the latter.

More importantly, these beers have a firmly established reputation as among the best beers in the world. When Ratebeer started to bestow its “Best Beer” award back in 2001, Westvleteren, Rochefort, and Chimay were ranked 1st, 2nd, and 4th respectively.[ref](https://www.ratebeer.com/ratebeerbest/default_2002.asp) Though the focus has shifted to craft beers since then, Westvleteren XII and Rochefort 10 still solidly occupy their top place in almost every rating.

#### How to taste

Of course, the original Trappists are the most authentic extra-strong darks/quads:

  * Westvleteren XII (which, let us remind you, is supposed to be sold on-premise only, and it's rather hard to find)
  * Rochefort 10
  * Chimay Bleue
  * St. Bernardus 12, though it's now a secular brew

A bit less famous are the beers made by the Association members who joined it a bit later:

  * La Trappe Quadrupel
  * Stift Engelszell Gregorius
  * Achel Extra Bruin
  * Zundert 10.

And, of course, a throng of commercial brewers are making *quadrupel*. To name a few: Belgians Gouden Carolus, Straffe Hendrik, and De Struise; and the craft ones including “Three Philosophers” by Ommegang and “Terrible” by Unibroue.
