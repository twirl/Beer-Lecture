### A Series of Unfortunate Events
##### Historical period: 1842 — ?
##### Scene of Action: Plzeň

The Middle-19th century was a triumph of brewing as an engineering discipline. Equipped with precise measuring devices (the thermometer, hydrometer, and areometer) and the newest microbiological discoveries (in 1837, Theodor Schwann proved that yeasts were living organisms), modern tech made brewing a precise science.

One of the vivid examples of such transformations happened in the town of Plzeň, Bohemia (then a part of the Habsburg Empire). Local burghers, the owners of the brewing rights (given to them by no one else than King Václav II himself in 1295), utterly disappointed ans exasperated by the quality Plzeň's beer, dumped 36 barrels of sour brew into the sewers and decided to build a new state-of-the-art brewery. To do so, they invited a brew master named Josef Groll from nearby Bavaria. In addition, they bought Bavarian lager yeasts, and built an English-style kiln.[ref:swinnen-briski-beeronomics:38]()

Beer Myth. According to legend, the lager yeasts were smuggled by an errant Bavarian monk. This is unlikely true simply because Bavarian monastic breweries were secularized by Napoleon. Burghers of Plzeň had in fact officially bought the yeasts from Bavaria.[ref:{"source":{"alias":"beer-culture","short":"Rail, E.","extra":["Beer Culture","Stories about great beer from the countries that invented it."],"href":"http://www.beerculture.org/"}}:"On the Founding of Pilsner Urquell, Part III"](http://www.beerculture.org/2012/09/19/on-the-founding-of-pilsner-urquell-mistakes/)

The first *new* beer was presented on November 11, 1842, and it was *nothing* like local ales or Bavarian lagers up to this point in time. Groll took the best Moravian barley and kilned the malt at extremely low temperatures. The new techniques resulted in light and crystal-clear beer — to which anyone could attest after pouring it into a goblet of Bohemian glass.

The taste of this new beer was quite unusual as well. It was light and crisp, like the beverage's appearance itself. Also, Groll used rather bitter hops (initially, some less known local strains but some time later Saaz AKA Žatec became a conventional hop for the beer). As a result, a new golden standard of beer was born: Pilsner (from “Pilsen,” a German name for Plzeň).

Surprisingly, the burghers of Plzeň were  not eager to export this beer,[ref:beer-culture:"On the Founding of Pilsner Urquell, Part II"](http://www.beerculture.org/2012/08/29/pilsner-urquell-founding-document-of-1839/) but it soon became irrelevant as all nearby brewers began brewing their own pilsners.

However, technical issues impeded the pilsner triumph. Making lagers still required a huge amount of ice. Fortunately, scientists helped with this problem as well:
  * In 1824, “the father of thermodynamics” Sadi Carnot enunciated his heat engines theory (the so-called “Carnot cycle”).
  * In 1834, Jacob Perkins received the first patent on refrigeration systems.
  * In 1856, James Harrison built the first ice-making machine.
  * Finally, in 1862, Ferdinand Carré exhibited the ice machine based on the Harrison invention that used ammonia as a refrigeration agent
From this point on cooling systems became commercially attainable.

The effect of refrigeration tecnology on the brewing industry was overwhelmingly transformative. In 1860, 32% of breweries in Bohemia were making lager. By 1870, it was 98%,[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lager), and in 1884 the last brewery that was still resisting progress and making warm-fermented beer was closed[ref](https://czechbeeralliance.co.uk/bohemian-brewing-history). After Bohemia, pilsner conquered the rest of Austro-Hungary (with refrigerated vans having been invented, the morning “beer train” from Plzeň to Vienna was launched[ref](https://www.prazdroj.cz/en/our-story/history)) then Germany, Netherlands, France, USA, and the entire world. So-called “eurolager” is the most popular beer style to this day.

#### How to taste them

The original pilsner is still being made: in 1898, the Plzeň breweries union had officially registered the “genuine Plzeň” trademark — Plzeňský Prazdroj in Czech, Pilsner Urquell in German — and to the present day continues to make lager beer under this brand.

In general, trying pilsner is one of the easiest things in the world. Just ask for a light beer in any bar or liquor store.

#### Tread of triumphants

It's rather hard to pinpoint one reason why pilsner became a dominant beer style in such a realtively brief time, and then with such longevity. Several factors converged:
  * An aura of the most fashionable and technologically advanced beer
  * An exceptionally light clear appearance and taste
  * The predictability of manufacturing; with refrigerators in hand, brewers no longer needed years of trial and error to brew quality beer
  * The advance of moderation societies in Europe and the US
  * The world wars and alcohol prohibitions in the first half of the 20th century that disrupted the traditional brewing business practices

The light lager offensive was uneven. Central Europe gave up almost instantly, while in the 1960s England lager was still under the radar.[ref:pattinson-shut-up:"Why do beer styles disappear?"](http://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2008/05/why-to-beer-styles-disappear.html) Nevertheless, lager domination became absolutely total by the end of the 20th century. Many countries were not producing beer of any other style at all. An entire generation of people had come of age, who thought beer might be either light, dark, or *cold-filtered* (as opposed to pasteurized) — e.g. a light, dark, or cold-filtered *lager*.

Fun Fact. The prolonged British resistance against lager by coincidence killed the business of Allsopp — *that* Samuel Allsopp who brewed the first Burton IPA. In 1897, his heir, Samuel Allsopp Jr., had invested the brewery's future in lager production that turned out to be a fiasco and led “Samuel Allsopp & Sons” into eventual bankruptcy in 1911.[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Allsopp_%26_Sons)

Under lager pressure, many other beer styles were forced to the lowest common denominator — light, thin, 4.5% ABV *beer*. The classic example is the Braunschweig's *mumme* evolution, which we mentioned in the “Bog Myrtle” chapter.

The decades from 1960s to the 1980s of the 20th century were probably the worst time for a beer lover, as it was virtually impossible to get anything but lager anywhere on the Earth, except for Britain where stouts and bitters were strong, Germany with its *Weissbier*, and little Belgium, to which the next section of this book is dedicated.

####  Hops geography

Until the 19th century, brewers didn't care about hop varieties. The main factor was a geographic only: beer producers were buying hops grown in specific regions. We here outline the three most important ones:
  * Hallertau: it is an area in Bavaria which had cultivated hops as early as the 8th century CE. Hallertau hops were a default choice for German lagers and many Belgian beers as well.
  * Saaz (AKA Žatec): the Bohemian region produced hops known since the 15th century CE and included in the canonical pilsner recipe[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saaz_hops);
  * Kent: it is the county in England with hop cultivation also dating from the 15th century.

Two main Kent hop varieties became known in the 19th century as “Golding” and “Fuggle.” To make life a bit more unclear, Fuggle was considered a variant of Golding and was often marked as “Fuggle's Golding,” so many of its derivatives do not contain the word “Fuggle” at all — the famous Slovenian “Styrian Golding,” for instance.

Fuggle and Golding were the progenitors of many contemporary hops varieties used by craft brewers. Both designations derived from surnames (most likely, of farmers that once grew them). However, as it often happens with the beer industry, nobody bothered to keep clear records on the matter, so we basically know almost nothing about who Mr. Golding and Mr. Fuggle actually were, except that they lived in 18th-19th century England.[ref:{"short":"Cornell, M. (2016)","extra":"Finding Mr. Fuggle: The Largely Mysterious History of England”s Two Greatest Hop Varieties"}](https://www.beeradvocate.com/articles/13523/finding-mr-fuggle-the-largely-mysterious-history-of-englands-two-greatest-hop-varieties/)

Fun Fact. At the beginning of the 20th century, Belgium was a major hop supplier, with Aalst, Asse, and Poperinge being the main production regions. Over the following 100 years, designated crop area had diminished 10 times, and Belgian hops were superseded by German ones.[ref:{"source":{"alias":"mulder-lost-beers","short":"Mulder, R.","extra":"Lost Beers.
