### The Beer Purity

##### Historical period: the 16th-17th centuries CE
##### Scene of action: Bavaria

Right after the beer trade had begun, early laws emerged for its regulation. Two main issues had vexxed authorities of all the brewing regions: ensuring the quality of the product and taxation. It's quite possible to track these specific aspects and to observe how the development of the brewing industry led to increasingly rigid and complex local legislation.[ref:unger-middle-ages:69]()

The first laws prescribing mandatory employment of *specific* brewing techniques have been known since the 12th century CE,[ref:meussdoerffer-history:26]() and generally speaking, were quite ordinary for any brewing region. Still, one of them is stands above all others: the Bavarian beer purity law of 1516, also known as *Reinheitsgebot* in German.

Fun Fact. “The Beer Purity Law of 1516” was not in truth about the beer purity, and was not adopted in 1516. However, it is widely known under that name. Such laws had been in effect independently in Munich since 1487 and throughout greater Bavaria since 1493. After Bavaria was united under Munich those two laws were merged into one, and this version from Apr 23, 1516 is called “Reinheitsgebot.”

Contrary to other cities where magistrates were haphazardly adopting and then soon canceling their beer laws, the Bavarians demonstrated a truly German obstinacy and love for order. Can you believe that adopting the *Reinheitsgebot* country-wide was a condition of Bavaria joining the united German state in 1871?[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot)

Beer Myth. On the Internet, you might find statements such as “the *Reinheitsgebot* was the first law regulating the quality of beer” (which is not true), or even food in general (which is *absolutely* not true as those laws already existed in Ancient Rome). It is also incorrect to say that the *Reinheitsgebot* is the oldest *acting* food industry law, because it was abolished by the European Court of Justice in 1987[ref:{"short":"Leonard, D.J.","extra":["10 Things You Might Not Know About the Reinheitsgebot (Beer) Purity Law of 1516","Beer Syndicate Blog"]}](https://beersyndicate.com/blog/10-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-reinheitsgebot-beer-purity-law-of-1516/): so the Bavarian adherence to principle have been rather diminished in the 100 plus years since the Bismarck's times.

The law consists of several clauses that might be grouped into two categories:
  * Price regulation (the law sets both the maximum retail price and the maximum allowed grist for resellers)
  * Beer quality assurance.

Fun Fact. Many beer regulations prescribed the maximum price just like the *Reinheitsgebot* did. So in case of poor harvests or monetary inflation, brewers were not able to raise prices. Instead, they might lower the quality bar by using less grain. That's one reason why popular beer brands degraded quickly, and new ones were constantly emerging.[ref:unger-middle-ages:187]()

Within this law, the famous formula is stated: beer must be brewed with only three ingredients, namely water, barley, and hops. So nowadays in popular opinion, the *Reinheitsgebot* is something like a “Silver Bullet” for ensuring beer quality. Brewers often mention it in their commercials, and craft bars are frequently named “1516.”

In reality, the importance of the formula was not about the ingredients it allowed, but rather the ingredients it prohibited. First, the *Reinheitsgebot* abolishes *gruit* and requires using hops only. Second, it was meant to ensure food security for the Bavarian burghers by prohibiting using non-forage crops for beer making, most importantly wheat.

#### Bavarian White

In the 15th-century Bavaria, a fashionable beer style emerged: white (*weisse*) beer that was lighter than Bavarian lagers because of some brewer manipulations. One of the means of “whitewashing” beer is using wheat (*Weizen*): wheat beer gets a high white foamy head, and wheat itself may be used fully or partly unmalted. By approximately the end of the 15th century, these two words — *Weissbier* (e.g. “white beer”) and *Hefeweizen* (literally, “yeast wheat”) — started to mean exactly the same thing, wheat beer.

There is no consensus among scholars whether using wheat for brewing was a real food security problem, but one fact is indisputable: by introducing the “Beer Purity Law,” Wilhelm IV had legally outlawed using any grain but barley. However, Wilhelm's son, Albrecht V, made an exception to this rule in a form of a state monopoly — presumably under consumer pressure of those unwilling to comply. Initially, the right to brew wheat beer had been granted to Count Degenburg, but after his death, this brewing *charter* reverted back to the Crown. The reigning Duke, Maximilian I, had quickly learned that this monopoly might bring considerable profits as Bavarians liked wheat bear immensely and were eager to pay for the “forbidden fruit,” especially as it was the only kind of beer allowed to be brewed in summer. Maximilian founded an entire network of state breweries, one of which — the former Weisses Bräuhaus — has survived until today.[ref:{"short":"Staudt, A. (2015)","extra":["Brewing Bavarian Weissbier – all you ever wanted to know","brau!magazin"]}](https://braumagazin.de/article/brewing-bavarian-weissbier-all-you-ever-wanted-to-know/)

Finally let us mention that beer made of wheat had been produced for millennia, starting with Sumerians and Egyptians. 14th-century Hamburg was particularly praised for its wheat beer.[ref:unger-middle-ages:185]() The Bavarians borrowed the technology from Bohemian brewers who had produced wheat beers since the 12th-13th centuries CE.[ref:{"source":{"alias":"oxford-companion","short":"The Oxford Companion to Beer (2012)","extra":["Edited by Garrett Oliver","ISBN 0195367138"]}}:"Weissbier"]()

#### How to Taste It

Out of the ten oldest breweries in the world, several are located in Bavaria.
  * Weihenstephaner: the brewery at the Weihenstephan Abbey was first mentioned in 1040 (though some scholars believe that the corresponding document is a later forgery, we know for sure about cultivating hops in the monastery garden since at least 768 CE) and is generally believed to be the oldest continuously operating brewery in the world.
  * Weltenburger: mentioned in the previous chapter, this abbey brewery is ten years younger than Weihenstephaner.
  * Augustiner-Bräu: the brewery at the monastery of the Augustine order, it was first mentioned in 1328, and was supplying beer to Bavarian dukes' households until the end of the 16th century.
  * Two breweries later formed the Spaten-Franziskaner Group: that of Spaten (existed since 1397) and Franziskaner (since 1363); the former, however, does not produce wheat beers and is much better known for its lagers.

There are also two slightly younger breweries:
  * Staatliches Hofbräuhaus (the “Hofbräu” trademark) — the “state court brewery” was founded by Wilhelm V himself in 1589.
  * G. Schneider & Sohn (the “Schneider Weisse” trademark) — the venture of Georg Schneider's that had eventually bought several former ducal breweries in 1924; one of them, *the* Weisses Bräuhaus in Kelheim, was established by Maximilian I at the beginning of the 17th century to implement the duke's monopoly on wheat beer.

There are reasonable doubts regarding the continuity of all these beer producers' traditions. For example, the Weltenburg abbey was disbanded in 1803 and reinstated only 40 years later. Still, the benchmark Bavarian wheat beers are produced by those companies, and the Weihenstephaner is considered to be the best.

As with *bock*, it's hard to tell if today's Bavarian *Hefeweizen* really resembles the historical *Weissbier* of the 16th century. Out of general consideration, the dukes' beer of that period would have been closer to what we now call a “weizenbock,” e.g. relatively strong dark wheat. The reference *weizenbock*s are *Mein Aventinus* (AKA *Tap 6*) by Schneider Weisse and *Vitus* by the Weihenstephan brewery.
