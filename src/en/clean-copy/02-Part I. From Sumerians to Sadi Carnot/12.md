### The Red Triangle
##### Historical period: the 19th century CE
##### Scene of action: Burton upon Trent

While the beer trade in the Baltics was stagnating, another prospective market was growing at a rapid pace: “The Jewel in the Crown,” e.g. India. The first beer shipments to Madras and other colonies were already mentioned by the beginning of the 18th century. Closer to the end of the century, however, all the trade had been monopolized by a single London brewer named Hodgson. His brewery, called “Bow Brewery,” was not even one of London's top-ten beer producers. Better yet, Bow Brewery was quite fortunately located next to the East India Trading Company headquarters. Hodgson pulled some strings, offered Company captains an 18-month credit line — and became the exclusive beer supplier for India.[ref:amber-gold-black:101]() The trade volume grew five-fold from 1775 to 1800 — from 240 thousand liters to 1.3 million.

Meanwhile, the Burton brewing industry was stagnating by the beginning of the 19th century. Just one brewery was opened between 1803 and 1827.[ref:brewing-in-burton:27]() However, in 1821, the wind of change and good fortune once again reversed its direction, to Burtoners greater glory. The East India Company got tired of Hodgson and his dubious business practices and his beer alike. They approached Burton's leading brewer, Samuel Allsopp, offering the opportunity to enter the Indian trade. Soon, another two Burton brewers joined Allsopp, namely Bass and Salt. Hodgson, being edged out, tried to counter this move but his ale was of no quality to compete. Soon the market fell into Burtoners' hands almost entirely.[ref:amber-gold-black:107]() In 1830, William Worthington also entered the market.

Initially, in the 18th century, the most common types of beer were shipped to India: pale ale, porter, Burton ale, and even “table beer.” Hodgson was a porter producer (and porter was actually a standard drink for soldiers and petty officers, and was supplied in great quantities to military garrisons, including those based in India[ref:zythophile:"More IPA myths that must die on #IPADay"](https://zythophile.co.uk/2012/08/02/more-ipa-myths-that-must-die-on-ipaday/)). However, dark beers were considered to be too heavy for a tropical climate while low-alcohol and slightly-hopped beers did not commonly survive the long voyage. So first of all, Hodgson was shipping his strongly hopped pale ale, and it was this same beer style brewed by Allsopp (according to the legend, in a teapot) when the Chairman Marjoribanks of the East India Company asked him to replicate the best Hodgson recipe. Let us remind you of Burton's water qualities that allowed for even paler and sparkling pale ales.

Fun Fact. Marjoribanks did not approach London porter brewers, but Allsopp because Burtoners had a reputation for expertise in long-distance ale shipping. As for Burton pale ales being so good, that may be deemed a bit of pure luck for them and us.

During the first five decades of the India trade, nobody bothered to create a  special designation for this product. Up until the end of the 1830s, there was *no specific name* for India-oriented beers. It was just “beer.”[ref:steele-ipa:"3":]() However, denoting its export qualities this style was slowly gaining such descriptions as “pale ale prepared for the East and West India climate,” “pale ale brewed for the Indian market,” and so on. Starting from the 1850s, in lieu of these bulky constructs, the phrase “India Pale Ale” prevailed. It looks like it was directly related to the extended railroad network to Burton in 1839. Bass and Allsopp shifted their focus to domestic sales and started to advertise their product extensively. Hodgson was not lagging behind nor sitting idly by. In 1844, his IPA was marketed as “having an excellent reputation in India for more than a century” (sic). Shortly after, the IPA sales within Britain exceeded Indian exports and IPA gradually became a beer for domestic consumption, becoming a status drink for the middle and upper classes.[ref:amber-gold-black:115]()

Beer Myth. There is a beautiful legend, first recounted in 1869 by Walter Molyneaux, a contemporary of these events, about a ship that wrecked near the British coast with its cargo of IPA later sold in Liverpool by the insurers. It was told that the commoners got a taste for the ale, and started seeking to buy it in large quantities. Though the part about the shipwreck turned out to be true (though Molino was mistaken about the dates), the connection of IPA's growth in popularity to the actual shipwreck is rather doubtful.[ref:zythophile:"The IPA shipwreck and the Night of the Big Wind"](https://zythophile.co.uk/2015/10/12/the-ipa-shipwreck-and-the-night-of-the-big-wind/)

The most prominent Burton brewer, William Bass, had created the first truly global beer brand. In 1887, at the peak of its fame, the Bass Brewery produced 150 million liters of beer in a year.

One might judge how popular Bass Pale Ale was by the fact it was depicted by several leading painters of the time, most notably in “A Bar at the Folies-Bergère” by Édouard Manet. In this picture, there are two easily noticeable bottles with the red triangle; the famous logo of the Bass Brewery. Also, it was the first registered trademark in Britain: it is said that William Bass sent a clerk to wait overnight so as to be the first in the queue the day the bureau opened, as Bass's company was suffering from treacherous competitors selling low-quality beer stamped with the red triangle.[ref:zythophile:"The Bass red triangle: things AB-InBev won”t tell you"](https://zythophile.co.uk/2013/06/28/the-bass-red-triangle-things-ab-inbev-wont-tell-you/)

#### The bitter confusion

Let us be clear: no difference between “India Pale Ale” and “Pale Ale” existed up until the second half of the 19th century. In particular, Bass Pale Ale was the canonical IPA that actually gave the style its fame. Many beer producers, noticing the growing popularity of “Ale for India,” were rebranding their most expensive pale stock ales as “IPA.”[ref:amber-gold-black:114]() Beer marked as “Pale Ale” even in the second half of the century still had an impressive bitterness of 60-80 IBU[ref:pattinson-shut-up:"Defining Pale Ale"](http://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2021/09/defining-pale-ale.html) (see below).

All those (I)PAs were stock ales meaning they were aged for 4-12 months or even more and secondarily fermented with *Brettanomyces*. However, with the growing popularity of the style and further technical progress, British brewers started to produce “mild” (e.g. unaged) versions by adding invert sugar (also, flaked maize and other additives) to wort and additionally refining it. This ale was denoted with the abbreviation “AK” (sometimes, “KK”) and was sold in casks as fresh as possible[ref:pattinson-shut-up:"What was AK"](http://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2021/06/what-was-ak.html) — in fact, it's exactly the thing that we now call a “real ale” (see the “Revitalisation” chapter).

Fun Fact. Martin Cornell suggests that the letters “AK” might mean “Ankel Koyt” (“single koyt”), therefore being an artifact of that epoch when the Dutch expats were brewing hopped beer in Britain[ref:amber-gold-black:17]() (see the “Word on Hops” and “Barrels and Bretts” chapters).

Consumers, however, had adopted neither of the terms; pub patrons called these beers just “bitters.” As a result, four different designations of the same style emerged:
  * India pale ale (British style)
  * pale ale (British style)
  * bitter
  * extra-special bitter, or ESB.

Most classifications currently identify them as four different beer styles, though, in fact, they are just subtypes of the “AK” beer, slightly varying in bitterness and alcohol content.

#### How to Taste It

Finding an “AK” is not a problem, as it's just a classical British ale. Out of breweries that had made it throughout the 20th century we might note American Ballantine India Pale Ale and British Worthington's White Shield (the latter still brewed in Burton). In general, British bitters have gotten quite a characteristic taste and are now produced in numbers by fine breweries — let us mention Fuller's, Adnams, Thornbridge, Greene King, Samuel Smith, Harviestoun, and Marston's.

Tasting a “real” IPA, the one that Hodgson and Allsopp shipped to India, is unfortunately not possible. To begin with, we have no idea what they were actually shipping. Out of four original East India Company suppliers (namely, Hodgson, Allsopp, Bass, and Salt), none have survived. The Bass trademark was bought by AB InBev, and Bass Pale Ale continues to be produced (under the pretentious “Bass Trademark No. 1 Ale” name) with the red triangle being redesigned beyond any recognition. However, it has nothing to do with the original Bass, and furthermore, the beer itself is quite mediocre.

Todays's craft brewers make some extensively hopped stock ales that should be very much like the real IPAs. For example, there are Brett IPA by Allagash and Enjoy After Brett IPA by Stone.

#### Bitterness Units

Bitterness of beer can be definitively measured. There are two main scales: international (IBU, International Bitterness Units) and European (EBU, European Bitterness Units). Beer with less than 30 IBUs is usually considered not bitter at all (though an English man of the 15th century wouldn't agree with that). Beer with 60 or more IBUs is definitely bitter, and many people will not like it (pale ale at this level of bitterness should be called an IPA). In the 30 to 60 range, every producer is free to decide whether to mark the beer as a pale ale, a bitter, an ESB, or maybe an IPA as well.

Thicker and stronger beers might conceal bitterness. Imperial stouts (see the next chapter) might easily have 100 IBUs, but it's hard to perceive the bitterness depth. Double-digit ABV and dark malts may dominate the flavor. Additionally, reaching more than 100 IBUs is possible but humnan taste buds don't register that level of bitterness.

The European bitterness scale theoretically should coincide with the international one. However, because of some technicalities, it's usually slightly lower.
