### The Beer of the Industrial Revolution
##### Historical period: the 18th century CE
##### Scene of action: London

At the end of the 17th century CE, all the prerequisites for the industrialization of brewing in England were in place. Small-scale and semi-professional ale producers were superseded by organized, commercially-minded beer brewers. There were more than 17 thousand licensed drinking premises in the country (one per 183 inhabitants),[ref:meussdoerffer-history:22]() and the beer business comprised 28% of GDP.[ref:{"source":{"alias":"steele-ipa","short":"Steele, M. (2012)","extra":"IPA: Brewing Techniques, Recipes, and the Evolution of India Pale Ale"}}:"2":]() However, no real *industry* existed as beer was consumed on-premise in those thousands of alehouses.

The impetus that catalyzed this industrialization emerged per usual due to an excise tax conflict. England entered the Nine Years' War of 1688-1697 and in its search of war revenue, the government in an exquisitely hellish manner, created a dishevelment within its taxation, raising beer levies dramatically.[ref:change-is-brewing:194]() Seeking remedy, brewers were forced to “optimize” their tax obligations and did find a loophole. From a legal standpoint, there were “strong” and “weak” beers, but the exact alcohol content had not been prescribed. So to ease the tax burden, one could brew a batch of very strong beer, pay the levies, and then dilute it with weak beer. This beverage prepared for future blending was called “double,” “three-threads,” or “stout” (meaning “hard”) beer. As a result, clandestine mixing of the unblended products to achieve a ready-made consumer product became a widespread practice among tavern keepers.[ref:change-is-brewing:219-226]()

Beer Myth. It's often said that the “three-thread” beer was a blend of three kinds of beer: stale, fresh, and pale. This is probably just an urban myth: “three-threads” was just a mix of keeping and running ales.[ref:zythophile:"The three-threads mystery and the birth of porter: the answer is …"](https://zythophile.co.uk/2015/06/05/the-three-threads-mystery-and-the-birth-of-porter-the-answer-is/) Still, mixing up just two threads was nevertheless a hard (and risky) job for tavern keepers.

In the end, beer production dropped, and tax revenues diminished to lower than before (partially, that was because of “shady” avoidance schemes of course, but the overall beer consumption still decreased significantly). In order to overcome the illicit stout blending, lawmakers introduced an additional levy on malt itself, which led to a further degradation and hobbling of the industry.[ref:change-is-brewing:228]()

These hide-and-seek games with the government were finally resolved at the beginning of the 18th century in a most progressive manner: some unnamed or forgotten innovators started to brew a beverage called “entire-butt” (or rather “intire-butt” as they spelled it those days), e.g. “the full barrel.” To make this beer, all four or five worts prepared from one batch of grain (in this case, the cheapest “brown” malt) were mixed back together again, intensely hopped, and then aged for some time in a large barrel (which was called “butt”).

There were other innovations: the inventors of that new beer were the first who approached beer production with an engineer's exactitude to control *precisely* how the product was prepared. In particular, they started drying malt by adhering to a specific temperature profile instead of just leaving it in a kiln for several days. The heat was gradually increased, then spiked sharply at the very end of the process. The malt “popped” like popcorn (this type of malt was conversely called “blown”[ref](https://brewingbeerthehardway.wordpress.com/2017/12/27/blown-vs-brown-malt/)). Wort made from this malt could ferment at a higher temperature meaning it was less likely to turn sour and was fit to be brewed in summer. As this beer spoiled less frequently and generally became less capricious, the sizes of “butt”-barrels began to increase thus allowing for scaling production. This product was ready-to-use, had removed the mixing stage, and most importantly, it cost half-penny less than analogous blended beers![ref:amber-gold-black:55]()

Interestingly, for the first 80 or so years this beer was simply called “entire-butt,” but finally another name took hold: *porter*. This beverage was so enormously popular among port workers that *porter* (initially just a euphemism) supplanted other names. One scholar claims that porter consumption provided 2000 calories per day for an average London port worker in the 18th century![ref:zythophile:"The forgotten story of London”s porters"](http://zythophile.co.uk/2007/11/02/the-forgotten-story-of-londons-porters/)

Basically, the earliest porters were pseudo-“keeping ales” made from the cheapest malts with lower ABV content (typical “old ale” was stronger). They would compensate for this lower alcohol by adding abundant hops. The scheme worked because lawmakers somehow overlooked the possibility of putting excises on hops as well.[ref:{"short":"Anderson, R. (2003)","extra":["Microbes and the Origins of Porter","Brewery History, 113, pp. 27-30"]}](http://www.breweryhistory.com/journal/archive/113/bh-113-027.html) Brown malt was cheap because it was dried in a wood kiln (thus absorbing smoky flavors) while quality malts were dried over more expensive straw. Even in the 1890s, some porters were advertised as having “the flavor of the wood,”[ref:amber-gold-black:55]() so by this time the consumers had presumably developed something akin to a Stockholm syndrome towards that conspicuous smell and taste. 

Fun Fact. later, in the middle 18th century, brewers started to keep porter for maturing, giving birth to the terms “mild porter” and “stale porter,” so tavern keepers did not long relish beer blending. The word “stout” had not been peacefully laid to rest: it soon became a designation for the thickest and heaviest porters. Also, porter itself was always a “beer,” not “ale.” Up until the middle 20th century you would have gotten a pint of porter if you had asked for a “beer” in a British pub.

London brewers took a pedantic approach not only towards brewing procedures but to the beer business as a whole, being very fastidious toward record keeping: when the beer was prepared, whom it was sold to, what was the price, etc. It was probably the first time in history when accountants became more important than master brewers themselves.[ref:swinnen-briski-beeronomics:31]() Later, in the 1770s, the Londoners were the first to start using specific measuring tools for brewing (namely, thermometers and hydrometers). Additionally, they were the first to install the first steam engines in breweries.[ref:meussdoerffer-history:24]()

The combination of these three factors — effectiveness, cheapness, and readiness for immediate use — fomented a revolution in the brewing industry, or rather *had created* the industry. “Entire-butt” took over London alehouses at lightning speed, and soon thereafter, the entire world. This beer style quickly became truly global, being shipped to the New World, Australia, the Russian Empire, India, and every other corner of the globe. 

The vat sizes were growing even faster. In 1736, Humphrey Parsons installed new fermentation vessels of a record 200 thousand liters each in his brewery; six decades later, the largest vat could hold close to three million liters of beer[ref:hornsey-history:449-450]() with its iron staples alone weighing 80 tons. In 1814, a relatively small 600 thousand liter barrel exploded and caused a real beer flood that killed eight people.[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Beer_Flood)

The production scale and the level of monopolization were increasing as well. Legislation favored large-scale brewers and in the middle 18th century just two of them — Calvert and Thrale — were controlling more than 40% of beer production in the city.[ref:change-is-brewing:237, 248]()

In 1751, painter William Hogarth created a pair of prints named “Beer Street” and “Gin Lane.” The former depicts urban porter connoisseurs — cheerful, buoyant, and healthy. (The latter, as you might have guessed, portrays exhausted and insane lovers of that god-awful gin.)

#### How to Taste It

It sounds unlikely, weird even, but the first truly global beer style (e.g., porter) had eventually all but vanished and was not produced at all in the United Kingdom from the beginning of the 1950s until 1978. Stouts were luckier, as they were (and are) brewed by plenty of companies, starting with an international giant, Guinness. Nevertheless, one should take into account that contemporary porters and stouts are brewed using more modern technology, including those of the second half of the 19th century (see the “Age of Empires” chapter), and were wholly distinct from the original “entire-butt” porters. Several reconstructions exist, most notably *Entire Butt English Porter* by Salopian Brewery, but it's rather hard to find them. The best approximation of the early English porter is actually the brown ale of Flanders, the story of which we will tell in Part II of this book.

If we talk about modern porters, the most hailed ones are English Fuller's *London Porter* and Samuel Smith *Taddy Porter* and Scottish Harviestoun *Old Engine Oil*.

#### The Trust that went Bust

Hogarth's diptych graphically outlines the brewing processes in 18th-century England. Being one of the first potent locomotives of the Industrial Revolution and the accumulation of capital, beer production was ultimately pushed aside by more advanced technologies. The tea, coffee, soft drinks, and strong alcohol industries were blooming and had soon become competitive powers (partly because of the re-investment of the capital originally made on brewing). Wealthy social stratum still preferred prestigious continental wine over beer; less prosperous common folk had switched to cheap gin.[ref:change-is-brewing:252-253]()

As the world population has been growing, the absolute beer industry numbers have also grown manifold since the 18th century. But the importance of brewing for the economy as well as average consumption has never reached those mind-numbing figures of the early-industrial period.
