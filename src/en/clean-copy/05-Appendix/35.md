### On Beer Styles, Ratings, and Recommendations

This book is written in a form of “lecture-degustation”: there are recommendations in each chapter, which beer style to try to fully understand the subject.

Today, there are several comprehensive and influential classifications of beers:
  * “The World Guide to Beer” by Michael Jackson;[ref:{"source":{"alias":"jackson-guide","short":"Jackson, M. (1997)","extra":["The New World Guide to Beer","ISBN 0894712926"]}}]()
  * “The Oxford Companion to Beer”;[ref:oxford-companion]()
  * Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) guidelines;[ref Beer Judge Certification Program 2015 Guidelines](https://dev.bjcp.org/beer-styles/introduction-to-the-2015-guidelines/)
  * beer style guidelines by the Brewers Association.[ref Brewers Association Beer Style Guidelines](https://www.brewersassociation.org/edu/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/)

All those, beyond any doubt, monumental works are, regrettably, equally monumentally contradict each other, and, even more regrettably, do not take into account the historical aspect: how all these beers emerged and what evolution underwent. That leads to anecdotical situations when the classifications sometimes recognize outright marketing hoaxes — for example, the “Irish Red Ale” which was simply invented by French Pelforth brewery in 1974.[ref:zythophile:"How one Irishman”s ginger beard helped launch an entirely bogus style of beer"](https://zythophile.co.uk/2021/08/25/how-one-irishmans-ginger-beard-helped-launch-an-entirely-bogus-style-of-beer/)

That's why in our recommendations we're trying to outline, first, modern beers closest to the historical styles (which frequently doesn't go well even with the most elaborate classifications; for example, Burton Ale or “entire-butt” porter haven't earned their place in the guidelines yet); and, second, the best modern interpretations of the style, sharing the same spirit with the original ones.

As for selecting the “best” or “most notable” beers, we're relying on different sources, namely, the most popular web services that provide beer ratings. Today, there are three of them:
  * [beeradvocate.com](https://beeradvocate.com)
  * [ratebeer.com](https://ratebeer.com)
  * [untappd.com](https://untappd.com)

These three sites are of the most use if you seek for recommendations. However, one needs to learn the basics of working with them first:
  * stronger brews are usually much higher rated, so the consolidated top is not very relevant as almost every Imperial stout will have higher grades than almost every session IPA;
  * tops by style are more demonstrative but are susceptible to another problem: they might easily comprise obscure beers with a dozen “A” grades given by brand enthusiasts.

All three services feature their own classifications of beer styles (needless to say, all three differ from one another, and from the above-mentioned guidelines as well). Ratebeer also provides a system of “tags” that is much more convenient for searching non-standard beers than “styles.”
